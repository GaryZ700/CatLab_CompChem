Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory, 
	By Attila Szabo and Neil S. Ostlund

	Restricted HF uses Roothan Equations, while the Unrestricted HF procedure uses the Pople-Nesbet Equations, Pg. 125

	Fock Operator sum of core-Hamiltonian and one electon potential operator called the Hartree-Fock potential

	Restricted Spin Orbitals have the same spatial functions for both spin up and down electrons, and only allows for calculations with even number of electrons for N/2 doubly filled spatial orbitals. Pg. 147

	Density matrix often guessed as 0, such that the Fock matrix is equal to the core hamiltonian alone. Pg. 163

	Guassin and Slater Determinat Definitions given on pg. 168
