When $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ are being integrated, $\\int\\psi_1\\psi_2d\\tau$, the resulting integral is the multiplication of two gaussians, such that the integration reduces to: $$[\\dfrac{\\pi}{(\\alpha+\\beta)}]^{\\dfrac{3}{2}}\\cdot e^{\\dfrac{-\\alpha\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\cdot|R_a-R_b|^2}$$\n",
