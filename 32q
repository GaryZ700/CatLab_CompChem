#Python Implementation of the Hartree Fock Method

#Step 1
#Specify Molecules, Nuclear Coordinates, Charge of the nucli, Atomic Orbitals basis functions, Number of Electrons

#Step 2
#Calculate Integrals
#Overlap, KE, Nuclear Attraaction, Electron Repulsion

#Step 3
#Dignolize Overlap Matrix and Obtain transformation matrix X

#Step 4
#Obtain guess Density matrix, P

#Step 5 
#Calculate Contraction of Density Matrix with Electron Repulsion, G Matrix

#Step 6
#Calculate Fock matrix, core matrix + G matrix

#Step 7
#Using X diagnolize Fock Matrix

#Step 8
#Diagnolize F' to get C' and E'

#Step 9
#Calculate C from C'

#Step 10
#From P for next iteration of HF Procedure

#Step 11
#Determine if current P is close "enough" to previos P, 
#	if no iterate again start from step 5
#	if yes, then stop iterating, HF procedure completed, and use final C matrix to compute physical properties
