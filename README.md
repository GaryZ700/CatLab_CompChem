# CatLab CompChem
This project is a Computational Chemistry library and framework built in Python that is designed to be class-based and modular to allow for rapid testing and prototyping of novel methods of solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. The project also focuses on pedagogy by containing informative Jupyter Notebooks that walk individuals through the matematics of certain portions of the library.
