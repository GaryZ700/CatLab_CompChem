## Hartree_Fock
A pedagogical focused Hartree-Fock computational chemistry method implementation. The implementation is for closed-shell Hartree-Fock limited only to hydrogen and helium atoms using basis sets soley utilizing guassian based s-orbitals.

## Morse_Potential
Code to plot a Morse Potential that describes the theory used in the potential, as well as the scientific relevance of the potential's parameters.

## Plane_Waves
Numerical Simulation of a moving plane wave. Provides a LateX discussion of a plane wave equation.

All code Written by Gary M. Zeri, Computer Science student at Chapman University.
All theory references are listed in the appropriate simulation folder.

Thank you to Dr. Jerry LaRue of the Chapman Chemistry department for his brilliant oversight and assistance on this endeavour.
