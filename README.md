hartree_fock notebook contains a well annotated hartree-fock code meant to serve for instructional use and for executing a single SCF run. Use of this code for computational purposes is best done through the Automated_HF notebook that allows for automating multiple SCF procedures with varying bond distances in order to compute the equilibrium bond distance.
