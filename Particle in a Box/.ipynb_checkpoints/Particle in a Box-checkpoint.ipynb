To allow the particle to soley exist wihin the respect of a box that begins at $x=0$ and ends at $x=L$, it can be stated that the potential beyond the boundries $x=0$ and $x=L$ are infinite, preventing the particle from escaping the box, and nothing between the boundaries of the box, allowing the particle to freely exist anywhere within the box. <br>\n",

    "From the above, it can been seen that the 2nd partial derivative of our function with respect to $x$ must produce the same wavefunction once again with a difference in sign.

The guess can now be tested with the boundry coefficents to determine the values of the constants $A$ and $k$.
