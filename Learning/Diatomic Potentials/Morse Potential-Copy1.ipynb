    "All information in this Jupyter notebook originates from <i>Diatomic Molecules According to the Wave Mechanics. II. Vibrational Levels</i> by Philip M. Morse.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuclear motion of a diatomic molecule can be described by the following equation: <br>\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2\\psi + \\frac{8\\pi^2\\mu}{h^2}\\left[W - E(r)\\right]\\psi = 0$$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of the variables used in the above equation and throughout this notebook follow below:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu = \\frac{M_1M_2}{M_1+M_2}$ <br>\n",
    "$M_1$ and $M_2$ are respectivly the nuclear masses for nucli 1 and nucli 2.<br>\n",
    "$Z$ refers to the atomic number of the respective atom.<br>\n",
    "$r$ refers to the bond distance between two atoms that form a diatomic molecule in units of $\\mathring{A}$<br>\n",
    "$V_e(r)$ refers to the electronic energy of the system.<br>\n",
    "$E(r) = \\frac{e^2Z_1Z_2}{r} - V_e(r)$ is the nuclear potential energy equation. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$E(r)$ can be considered to be the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear repulsion force. The exact form of this equation is unknown due to its non-trival relation with the electronic quantum numbers and $r$, thus approximations are used instead of the exact $E(r)$. The approximations used must satisfy the following conditions, which are directly quoted from Morse's paper. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function should come asymptotically to a finite value as $r\\rightarrow \\infty$\n",
    "2. The function should have its only minumum point at $r=r_0$\n",
    "3. The function should become infinity, or very large, at $r=0$\n",
    "4. The function should give the allowed energy levels equivalent to the finite polynomial:\n",
    "$$ W(n) = -D + h\\omega_0\\left[\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-x\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above finite polynomial is derived from two series used to approximate $E(r)$, and the function proposed by Morse that satisfies the above condtions is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(r)=D\\cdot e^{-2a\\left(r-r_0\\right)}-2D\\cdot e^{-a\\left(r-r_0\\right)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, with algebraic manipulation, can also be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E\\left(r\\right) = D\\left(1-e^{\\left(-a\\left(r-r_0\\right)\\right)}\\right)^2 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the first equation will touch the x-axis, while the second equation will be above the xaxis by an amount of $D$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below follows definitions for variables used in the Morse Potential: <br>\n",
    "$D$ is the well depth for the diatomic molecule's nuclear potential energy in $\\frac{1}{\\mbox{cm}}.$ <br>\n",
    "$r_0$ is the optimal diatomic bond distance at which the nuclear potential energy is at a minimum in units of $\\mathring{A}$.<br>\n",
    "$\\omega_0$ is the frequency of classical vibrations at $r_0$ in units of $\\frac{1}{cm}.$<br>\n",
    "$a$ is related to $\\omega_0$ by $\\omega_0 = \\frac{a}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{2D}{\\mu}\\right)^{1/2}$, which can also be expressed as $a=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\omega_0^2\\mu}{D}}$. <br>\n",
    "Where $\\mu$ refers to the reduced atomic mass of the system in units of AMU."
